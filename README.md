# MSc Projects

This repository contains a collection of projects undertaken during my MSc Scientific Computing with Data Science program. Each project explores different scientific and computational challenges, implemented primarily using Python and Jupyter Notebooks.

## Projects Overview

- **Biscuit Dunking**: Analyses the optimal conditions and physics behind biscuit dunking.
- **Drug Conformer Identification**: Utilises computational chemistry techniques to identify and analyse drug conformers.
- **Food Chains**: Models ecological food chains to study predator-prey dynamics and ecosystem stability.
- **Three Body Simulation**: Simulates the three-body problem to explore gravitational interactions and orbital mechanics.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Numpy, SciPy, Matplotlib, and other scientific libraries

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/JasmineDeh/MSc-Projects.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to a project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd MSC-Projects/biscuit_dunking
   ```

3. **Install required packages**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Open the Jupyter Notebook**:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
